1. In your own words, describe the two motivations for defining functions in your programs:
    a. The first motivation is to reduce duplicate code and make things reusable or modular. The second is to organize code better and increase your ability to read, understand, and debug
2. We have been thinking about computer programs as sequences of instructions where the computer methodically executes one instruction and then moves on to the next one. Do programs that contain functions fit into this model? Explain your answer.
    a. I do think that programs containing functions fit into this model. Executing a function in python causes the main function to pause while the new function is executed. Only once that function has executed does control return to the main function, maintaining one instruction at a time.
3. Parameters are an important concept in defining functions.
    * What is the purpose of parameters
    * What is the difference between a formal parameter and an actual parameter?
    * In what ways are parameters similar to and different from ordinary variables?
    a.
